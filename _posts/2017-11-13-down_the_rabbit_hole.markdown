Well Sinatra kicked my butt... 
It kicked and kicked and kicked my butt. 

A quick rewind is in order. I had worked my way through most of the Sinatra section and was approaching the Fwitter lab (basically building a twitter clone with Sinatra). I felt like I still didn't have a true grasp on a few of the key concepts. I was confused by routes and helper methods. I decided to step back for a couple days and review the section before moving on...
Then we got word that my wife got a job offer on the other side of the country. This moved quick (like in days) we were suddenly trying to sell our house, pack up everything we owned and keep our two young kids from flipping out through it all. Throw in a destination wedding and a trip to our new hometown to house hunt and it suddenly became a very busy, spicy month. 
Fast forward 3 weeks and we got it all done - packed it up, drove it all across country. 
We settled in - I looked at my computer and felt like puking. Code ? What's code ? 

I felt so badly out of touch - it had been a stressful month and I felt like I hadn't thought about any of this stuff for like a decade. 

So time to rewind. I actually went back AGAIN and reviewed Active Record and Sinatra. Deleting all my labs and passing all the spec tests again. 


I realized it wasn't as bad as I feared. Once I got back into the swing of things after a day or two things felt pretty good. I was surprised how I got into a flow and just tore through stuff..

I also realized that these projects are starting to get fairly complex. As I worked on my portfolio project I kept thinking of features I wanted to add, but don't have the knowledge to do. 

I find that exciting. 
The more I learn the more I realize what else I need to learn. I'm starting to see some of the possibilities of this stuff and can't wait to learn how to make them happen !

Plus I don't want to move again for a long long time.
