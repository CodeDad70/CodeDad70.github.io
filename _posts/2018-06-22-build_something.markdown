I've had a couple tech interviews and a couple assesements recently. The result of that has been a long couple weeks of code challenges, algorithms, code warrior and study study study. 
This has been great (and necessary) but I was starting to lose sight of why I love coding in the first place  - that is to build things ! 
To see an app come together piece by piece is something that really inspires me and helps me problem solve. 
Banging my head against algorithms is well and good, but I miss seeing something come together into a living, functional app. 
There is never enough time (ever!) but I need to try to make some for actually building things alongside the studying and code challenges. I learn by practical application and there is nothing more practical than trying to get your app to run ! Plus it is just a lot of fun....
