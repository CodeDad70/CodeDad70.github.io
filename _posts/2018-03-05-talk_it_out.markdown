I have done several team projects throughout the curriculum at Flatiron to varying degrees of success. Up until now it's  been the same approach. My partners and I would take different sections of the projects and work on it separately then put the code together to finish things up. I say varing degrees of success because stitching it back together was at times really pretty challenging . 

When I got to the JQuery Tic Tac Toe with Rails project my partner suggested a different approach. Because of those problems with stitching separate code together she suggested we screenshare and talk through the project as we wrote the code in real time.

I agreed to give it shot - but I was a bit nervous about it truth be told. I was worried I wouldn't remember syntax of basic things and look like a dummy when I had to look stuff up. I worried about drawing a complete blank and umming and aaaaing. 

It turns out it was a great idea! Once I swallowed my pride a bit and stopped worrying about knowing everything we settled in and had a great time working our way through a pretty complex project. It turns out articulating your thoughts about code can be a bit challenging but it REALLY helps you solidify your understanding of it. In order to explain to someone else how you think your code should work or what your approach should be you really have to think through your understanding of that approach. Also, having someone else coming up with solutions to try out that I would not have thought of myself was immensly helpful and helped deepen my knowledge of things. Sometimes a different approach is staring you right in the face - you just need someone else to point it out to you. 

I'm really glad my partner on this project suggested we screenshare and code together. It was a lot of fun and really helped me grasp some Javascript and JQuery concepts that I was struggling with. Next time you have a team project give it a try ! Oh and shout out to my partner Alexis - great work !
