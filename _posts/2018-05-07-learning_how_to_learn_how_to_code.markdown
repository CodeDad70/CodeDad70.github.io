My time here at Flatiron School has been incredible. It's been challenging, frustrating, rewarding and fun ! 

As I approach the end of this program I can't help but look back at where I started. The amount of concepts and code I have learned is dizzying but more importantly my understanding of what coding is and it's process has completely evolved. 

It's taken me a while, but I'm learning to slow down when things go wrong. Do some research, read some documentation and sniff around on google. I'm less afraid to try things out, throw some different ideas at the problem and see what sticks. Experimentation with different approaches doesn't seem to feel completely overwhelming these days. 

Things can still be frustrating, super confusing and challenging. (trying to get my rails app to work on Heroku for the first time is a good example). 

This leads me to the biggest lesson I've learned : I will never stop learning. 
This is what makes coding one of the most interesting and challenging occupations out there. It just never stops evolving - so I can't stop evolving.  It's an aspect of this I love. 

The more I learn the more I realize how little I really know. There are endless trick and approaches to problems. There are more advanced concepts I haven't even started wrapping my head around.  There are more languages to learn, platforms to experiment with and libraries to play with. 

I love building things. Coding is the endless toolbox to make things limited only by knowledge and imagination. 

I am excited for the future - I want to learn more and to build more. I feel like Flatiron School has given me the foundation I needed to build on. For that I'm very grateful !
