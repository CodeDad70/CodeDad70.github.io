I've been doing a lot of reading up on Javascript this week and I thought I would share a few articles I found that were really interesting and helpful!

I've been trying to wrap my head around prototypal inheritance and functional programming in JS. Not just what those things mean, but why and how to implement them in my code. I found this two part series that was really interesting :

https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4

The first part in the series is about using Object.create() to escape Class based Objects. The second part is a in depth look at functional programming. 

Kyle Simpson , author of You Don't Know JS has a similar article about objects without classes or OLOO — Objects Linking to Other Objects:

Finally I have really been trying to work on time-complexity and figure out big-o notation. I found this article pretty helpful at understanding it a bit :

These were some pretty good articles I found really informative. I hope it helps you understand some interesting concepts in JS that I personally have been working to wrap my head around !
