This week I had my first white board interview. I've heard about it, stressed about it and dreaded the in-person tech  interview for a while now. It turned out to not be too bad ! I learned a few things and gained some tips for preparing I thought I would share...

Learn some algorithms :
I made a list of some of the more common interview algorithms and practiced them. Over and over and over (and over) again. The key here is not just memorization, but to learn and understand why the solutions work. This is important because it's very likely the algorithm you will be given might be similar to the one you worked on, but it will probably be different in key ways. Understanding the concepts behind the solutions will help you adapt and be able to solve the algorithm you are given.  Just a few I would recommend are the Fibonnacci sequence, check a word to see if it's a palindrome, given a number return the prime factors, and given a word that is camelCased break it up. 

Practice practice practice : 
Practice WRITING out your algorithms. If you don't have a white board just write it out on a piece of paper. The important thing here is write it out by hand. I don't know about you but I don't write things out by hand much anymore. I was glad I practiced because it felt weird at first ! Get back in the swing of hand writing ahead of time so you aren't adapting to it under pressure during an interview. Writing things by hand really reinforces memorization too, so write out each algorithm a few times to get the feel of it and help drive it home to your memory.

Talk to yourself:
As you write out your algorithms talk out loud ! Explain each step - why you are doing what you are doing and how. "I am using a for loop here to iterate through my array. That way I can use i as an index..." Being able to talk out loud about your approach and your understanding of what you are doing is WHY THEY ARE DOING THE WHITEBOARD AT ALL. Practice this a lot. It is crucial.

Stay zen:
Be calm, breathe and go with the flow. It's been said a million times in a million places but the whiteboard isn't about you solving the problems. It's about how you communicate your thinking and how you work with the interviewer to reach a solution. Constantly remind yourself of this during the whiteboard, don't get panicked if you feel stuck ! Ask questions - reason your way through stuff out loud. Mostly just take a deep breathe and be your awesome self !

The in-person tech interview is nerve wracking, there is no getting around that.  But if you do your homework, feel as prepared as you can and come into it with a clear head it doesn't have to be terrifying. Do the work ahead of time and you can (and will ) do great ! Good luck !!
