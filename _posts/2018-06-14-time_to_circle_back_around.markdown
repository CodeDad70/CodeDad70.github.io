I had my first tech interview today. It was nerve-racking leading up to it, but once it got rolling it actually wasn't too bad. I think it went pretty well, but I was suprised that I struggled harder than I should to answer a React question. 

This got me thinking about things. I think I've fallen into a common trap.  As I've been looking for jobs I can't help but notice listings looking for "familiar with Angular.js" or "must know Node.js" . I went to a meetup and heard all about RX.js and how awesome it is and decided I need to learn all about it. I've been a scatter brain darting around from one library to the next, trying different code alongs and reading different articles. While all this is fun and interesting I need to solidfy and reinforce the things I have already learned. 

I have realized it's time to circle back around and get some repetition in. I need to build a few apps, get some muscle memory in the things know. Then expand on those, THEN expand my horizons. 

Writing good code is a long process. It will be a while before I can jump from framework to framework, I need to give myself time to really feel comfortable in the discplines I've learned. That only comes with time and practice practice practice...
