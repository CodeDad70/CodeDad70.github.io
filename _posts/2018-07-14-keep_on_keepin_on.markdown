This week has felt like a bit of a grind. I've been putting in a lot of job applications and pretty much waiting to hear back from a lot of folks. It's had that hurry up and wait kind of feeling that can be pretty frustrating. I felt stuck in a rut a bit by this and tried a couple things that kind of helped...

- Get some new perspective - This may sound strange but I hotspotted my phone, when and sat in a park and wrote some code. It was nice to just be in a different environment. It helped clear my head a bit and allowed me to focus on writing some code instead of stressing about everything else. 

-  Check in with the community -  I went to a final project presentation for a local code school. It was very inspiring to see what the students came up with for their final projects. It also helped to talk to folks that had just gone through a learing experience similar to mine. It was nice to be around like minded people, making me feel less isolated. Less like I'm just "waiting around " 

 - Keep learning - I've been working my way through You Don't Know JS (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) . It's a great book and it helps to continue learning. Reading through a book, learning and reinforcing concepts helps me feel less like I'm spinning my wheels on the job hunt.

Job hunting can be a bit of a grind. I felt the grind a bit this week so I tried a few tricks to help my perspective and keep me coding !
