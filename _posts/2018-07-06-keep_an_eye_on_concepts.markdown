Exactly one week ago I had a technical interview for Javascript and React. This afternoon I had a technical interview for Rails. A couple weeks ago I was studying furiously for the JS interview. Going over algorithms and reading and re-reading concepts that I had trouble grasping. 

After I finished that interview I prepared to do the same things in Rails. I was pleasently surprised to find it didn't feel like as much of a slog. Sure there where a lot of things specific to Ruby and Rails that I had to go back over to referesh in my mind. But I was happy to find that all the really rough leg work I did getting ready for the JS interview translated in a lot of ways to Ruby ! 

I started working on algorithms and realized that because I had really drove the concepts behind them into my mind it was simply a matter of  "okay how do I do this for loop in Ruby ? ". I was relieved to discover this stuff is sinking in. The concepts are there and moving from one language to another is starting to feel like a less daunting task. 

Approaching the problem critically is the challenge - remembering if it's for or .each becomes a secondary and pretty minor hurdle. I am not there by any stretch, but I'm starting to see how that comes together. It was an encouraging glimpse into the future of my developer growth !
