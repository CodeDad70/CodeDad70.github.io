I've been feeling nervous about CLI Data Gem project for a couple weeks. My mentor told me it was a doozy and this project started taking on a reputation of it's own. It was hanging over my head like the Sword of Damocles.... Every lab I finished brought me one step closer to it. 
The day finally came - my partner and I submitted Tic Tac Toe with AI, there was nothing else in the way. 
So I promptly put it off. 

I'm actually glad I did. What I did instead of diving in to it straight away was watch the CLI Gem walkthrough video. The next day I figured I would try to set up a test gem using bundler and get a feel for that.
It went very poorly. 
So I watched the walkthrough video again but this time I coded along with Avi. I created my own local version of the Daily Deal Gem he makes in the video. It was enormously helpful for me. I would pause a lot, try my own versions of the scrape etc. 
I learn best by doing things - it just helps everything sink in when I am typing the code in myself. My plan going forward is to code along with every lecture video. I'm thinking it may be a good review tactic for some of the more tricky concepts...

The next time I tackled creating the gem it went much smoother. I wish I could say the same for writing the code itself ! 

This gem was a uphill battle every step of the way.  I started feeling a salmon swimming upstream.. a very fast, very lonnngggg stream. 

I kept plugging away and reminded myself of some of the things I'd learned so far. Things like - Errors are my friend, just try to change it to a new error. Just keep working on one method at a time. 
It really helped. I got my CLI put in and created a working interface with fake data. THEN I focused on the scraping part. It was super helpful to focus on a small section - get it working then move on. 

Things suddenly didn't feel so overwhelming. I realized I was no longer seeing this as a huge, scary project that I had to tackle head on, but a serious of small riddles and problems to fix one by one. 

This felt like a breakthrough for me. I needed that shift in perspective and the only way I was going to get to it was by beating my head against the code wall a bit. I'm sure this won't be the last time I feel overwhelmed by a big project - but I'm hoping next time I can remind myself of the lessons I learned through the CLI Gem project and adapt a bit easier.
