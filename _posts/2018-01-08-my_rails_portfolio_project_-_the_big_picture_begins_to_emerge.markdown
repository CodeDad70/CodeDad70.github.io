I was about half way through my working on my rails portfolio project. I had waded through some pretty brutal nested forms and route problems, and things were starting to come together. 

I decided wanted some optional information to reveal itself on a user's show page only if they entered a value for it instead of having a blank field. 
"Good place for a helper method " I muttered to myself. I threw the method together, cleaned up my partial, hit refresh and it was good to go. 
I realize that's pretty straightforward and barely worth noting. What struck me however is where I had struggled so much before -  remembering what goes in the views, models, helpers etc  didn't even cross my mind. I just saw a need for a method, put it together and wired it up. 

I guess it signaled to me that I am starting to see the whole picture.  I'm starting to feel comfortable enough with that Rails app as a whole that I am no longer asking myself " what tools do I have here" but instead "what tools do I want to use here ".

It felt like progress and it was awesome ! 
Of course almost immedietly after that I ran into a checkbox collect problem with my custom setter that knocked me right back off my high horse, so let's not get carried away. 

I may have leveled up a touch - but I have no illusions about the mountains of learning I have ahead of me.  I did get a glimpse of the big picture for a second however -  not only did things not feel so overwhelming but they were even a bit familiar !
I'll take it !
