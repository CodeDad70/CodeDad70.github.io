I have been a graphic designer for nearly 2 decades. I started in the late 90's at a full service design house doing stuff like packaging graphics and logo design. I've floated around the edges of coding for years - learning a bit of HTML and using Dreamweaver and Flash (olden days ! ) for interactivity.  I never felt like I could actually write code though - it seemed completely daunting and I always shied away from it. It was some sorcery beyond the grasp of mere mortals like me.
I wound up more in the print end of things as years went on and before long it got increasingly hard to find design work. It's become a very saturated market and the pay is just not competitive at all. 

My family and I recently moved to Colorado from NYC. There is a lot of tech manufacturing here. As a result I decided to change things up and took a machining program. Part of that program was learning to write code for CNC machines - big huge mills and lathes. It's not nearly as complex as web development - but as I was learning that code it dawned on me that with some hard work I could learn to write code, it wasn't some total sorcery beyond my grasp. 
I recently got laid off my job as a machinist. Between 3d printing, exporting of manufacturing jobs and lets just say the current "political climate" the writing is on the wall - machining's days are numbered. 

I felt like I needed to pivot again.  After a lot of thought and research I decided to quit being afraid and embrace the code. 

I am more than a bit nervous. It still feels daunting. I hit some of these labs and a voice in my head starts going "you're screwed dude, you are in over your head ! Old dog new tricks blah blah"  But I just keep plugging away at it and chipping away at it. 
I know it will be hard - but that's okay, hard work doesn't scare me. I can feel myself learning and it feels good. 

I will learn to stop worrying and love the code !
