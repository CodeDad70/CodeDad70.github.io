This week I'm at a big family reunion. While we were chatting away someone asked me basically what programming was and how the whole thing worked. 
I found it really interesting trying to explain modern web apps in the least technical terms possible. Explaining the concept of the DOM and SPA's was very challenging. But what I noticed was that by forcing myself to think it through enough to explain things it really helped clarify concepts in my mind. Walking someone that has no tech knowledge  through how an app runs is a really good way to zoom out a bit and really look at the process as a whole. It helped challenge my understanding and really think things through so I could explain myself. 

At this point we've all heard about rubber ducking, talking your way through a problem out loud to help you see your way through it.  This was a interesting variation on that idea. 

Next time someone you know asks you what programming is or what you do instead of just saying "confusing computer stuff" try talking them thought it, it might help you solidify some concepts in your own mind !
